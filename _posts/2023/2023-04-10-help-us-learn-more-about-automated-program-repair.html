  Researchers from George Mason University
  (Fairuz Nawer Meem and <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/">Dr. Brittany Johnson</a>)
  are interested in hearing about your experiences in using automated program repair tools
  when carrying out software engineering tasks (e.g., writing code, finding and fixing bugs).
</p>
<p>
  You can help by completing a ~20 min online survey to share your experiences.
  Upon completion, you will be given the opportunity to enter yourself in a raffle
  for one of four electronic gift cards worth $50 (e.g., Amazon gift card) via email as compensation for your time.
  If you are able, please complete this 20-minute recruitment survey to help us:
