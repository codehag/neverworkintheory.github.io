    Peer Instruction (PI) is a teaching method that supports
    student-centric classrooms, where students construct their own
    understanding through a structured approach featuring questions
    with peer discussions. PI has been shown to increase learning in
    STEM disciplines such as physics and biology. In this report we
    look at another indicator of student successâ€”the rate at which
    students pass the course or, conversely, the rate at which they
    fail. Evaluating 10 years of instruction of 4 different courses
    spanning 16 PI course instances, we find that adoption of the PI
    methodology in the classroom reduces fail rates by a per-course
    average of 61% (20% reduced to 7%) compared to Standard
    Instruction (SI). Moreover, we also find statistically significant
    improvements within-instructor. For the same instructor teaching
    the same course, we find PI decreases the fail rate, on average,
    by 67% (from 23% to 8%) compared to SI. As an in-situ study, we
    discuss the various threats to the validity of this work and
    consider implications of wide-spread adoption of PI in computing
    programs.

    This paper, which has just been presented at SIGCSE 2013 in
    Denver, may be one of the most significant empirical results we've
    ever reported. As the abstract says, a specific teaching technique
    can cut the failure rate in introductory classes by more than
    half; it also increases self-reported learner satisfaction. To
