We are very grateful to Jesica Formoso and Jimena Saucedo for translating
the [talks given at Strange Loop]({{ '/#strange-loop-2022-09' | relative_url }})
earlier this year into Spanish.
Our [home page]({{ "/" | relative_url }}) now has links to the transcripts,
and they are available as subtitle tracks on
[Strange Loop's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@StrangeLoopConf) as well.
