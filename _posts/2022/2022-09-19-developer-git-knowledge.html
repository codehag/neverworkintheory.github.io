    Git, aptly described by the paper as <q>a cross-platform and open-source distributed version control tool</q>, is as
    popular as it is confusing and misunderstood. At least, that is an often expressed sentiment in the
    software development community. Now, the authors attempt
    to move this lament from a meme towards a quantitatively established web of validated effects. And they do a good
    job! In a way, this study
    may be seen as a complement to <a href="https://neverworkintheory.org/2016/09/30/rethinking-git.html">more
      qualitative approaches to the question of Git's usability</a>.

    Yang, Zhang, Pan, Xu, Zhou and Huang use the popular developer Q&amp;A platform Stack Overflow as well as a survey to
    attain large
    quantities of data. Armed with that, they express the following five aims:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Establish how many questions (on Stack Overflow) relate to Git commands and how this changes over the years.</li>
    <li>Find out who is asking these questions: novices or seasoned devs?</li>
    <li>List which Git commands elicit the most questions.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, find out for which commands it is hardest to get questions answered about.</li>
    <li>Get an idea how devs approach learning Git and how they are doing.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To these ends, the researches use a fairly complex and well-described pipeline of statistical tools. As far as I am
    able to tell they follow best practices, including the discussion of limitations, potential pitfalls and
    irregularities in the data. Thus, the paper may serve as a positive example of eliciting answers from large data sets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us then take a peek at the findings in
    regards to the five goals described above:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Over 80,000 questions relate to Git commands at the time of writing. That's a lot! The percentage of Git-related
      questions on SO remains fairly stable over time, with their view count being far above that of the average question.</li>
    <li>
      Over 40% of people asking questions about Git have been on SO for over four years, suggesting this is not what we
      could call a "noob problem".
    </li>
    <li>
      The most viewed questions relate to <code>git revert</code> and <code>git reflog</code>, with <code>stash</code>,
      <code>clean</code> and <code>reset</code> being close contenders. Relatable, I would say.
    </li>
    <li>
      Threads with no <em>Accepted Answer</em> are unsurprisingly dominated by rarely used commands such as
      <code>pack-redundant</code>. When filtering for more commonly commands, threads that discuss complex scenarios
      relating to commands like <code>git submodule</code> turn out to be the least answered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Supported by a survey, the authors find that almost all devs use a self-learning approach to Git. They often
      stress
      the importance of learning Git properly, while describing themselves mostly as 'advanced beginner' or
      'competent'.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    With these findings in mind, the authors give some recommendations to
    researchers, educators and devs: Firstly, using SO public data is confirmed
    to be a potent data source for such studies. They both encourage others to
    use the very data they found as well as building upon the research. Findings
    such as the list of most 'difficult' commands may be used to design and
    adapt teaching programs, whether these are university courses or
    self-learning curricula. I definitely agree that there is a dire need for
    more and better targeted Git courses - the fact that most developers teach
    themselves <em>and</em> the fact that understanding of Git is widely elusive
    shows that there is indeed room for improvement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I can only repeat that this paper does a very thorough job at
    collecting relevant data. These findings can be readily used to aid the
    improvement of your own development skills, the design of learning material
    or even Git itself. I can only hope more studies which also formulate
    solutions will follow.

    Git, a cross-platform and open-source distributed version control tool,
    provides strong support for non-linear development and is capable of
    handling everything from small to large projects with speed and
    efficiency. It has become an indispensable tool for millions of software
    developers and is the de facto standard of version control in software
    development nowadays. However, despite its widespread use, developers still
    frequently face difficulties when using various Git commands to manage
    projects and collaborate. To better help developers use Git, it is necessary
    to understand the issues and difficulties that they may encounter when using
    Git. Unfortunately, this problem has not yet been comprehensively
    studied. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we conduct a large-scale
    study on Stack Overflow, a popular Q&amp;A forum for developers. We extracted
    and analyzed 80,370 relevant questions from Stack Overflow, and reported the
    increasing popularity of the Git command questions. By analyzing the
    questions, we identified the Git commands that are frequently asked and
    those that are associated with difficult questions on Stack Overflow to help
    understand the difficulties developers may encounter when using Git
    commands. In addition, we conducted a survey to understand how developers
    learn Git commands in practice, showing that self-learning is the primary
    learning approach. These findings provide a range of actionable implications
    for researchers, educators, and developers.
