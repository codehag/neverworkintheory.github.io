    Recent research indicates that "people" factors such as ownership,
    experience, organizational structure, and geographic distribution
    have a big impact on software quality. Understanding these
    factors, and properly deploying people resources can help managers
    improve quality outcomes. This paper considers the impact of code
    ownership and developer experience on software quality. In a large
    project, a file might be entirely owned by a single developer, or
    worked on by many. Some previous research indicates that more
    developers working on a file might lead to more defects. Prior
    research considered this phenomenon at the level of modules or
    files, and thus does not tease apart and study the effect of
    contributions of different developers to each module or file. We
    exploit a modern version control system to examine this issue at a
    fine-grained level. Using version history, we examine
    contributions to code fragments that are actually repaired to fix
    bugs. Are these code fragments "implicated" in bugs the result of
    contributions from many? or from one? Does experience matter? What
    type of experience? We find that implicated code is more strongly
    associated with a single developer's contribution; our findings
    also indicate that an author's specialized experience in the
    target file is more important than general experience. Our
    findings suggest that quality control efforts could be profitably
    targeted at changes made by single developers with limited prior
    experience on that file.

    The findings are a bit hard to parse from the abstract, but the
    upshot is that (a) code worked on by a single developer (as
    opposed to many developers) is more often implicated in defects,
    and that (b) while a developer's general experience in a project
    is not correlated with the rate of defects introduced in it, the
    developer's experience with <em>the file in question</em>, in
    particular, is correlated with a lesser likelihood of introducing
    defects in it.
