<p>
  Many of my data science colleagues use Jupyter notebooks or RMarkdown in their work,
  and they have all occasionally been misled by what they seen on the screen.
  Chunks of code in notebooks can be executed in any order or not executed at all,
  so it's possible (or even common) for plots, tables, and code to be out of sync.
  This paper presents a tool for tracing dataflow dependencies between cells
  that involves labeling the stages of a typical machine learning pipeline.
  The authors evaluated their tool by scraping notebooks created in GitHub repositories
  on two successive days (to avoid biases that might be introduced
  by only looking at notebooks from popular repositories),
  and found that their approach was more accurate than two previously-published techniques.

  Computational notebooks are clearly here to stay,
  so it's great to see researchers looking at ways to make them better.
  And just as experience with the shortcomings of languages like C and C++
  led to the design of languages like Rust,
  I hope that analysis of the problems with today's notebooks
  will lead to the design of languages that are naturally more notebook-friendly.

    Data analysis is an exploratory, interactive, and often collaborative process.
    Computational notebooks have become a popular tool to support this process,
    among others because of their ability to interleave code, narrative text, and results.
    However, notebooks in practice are often criticized as hard to maintain and being of low code quality,
    including problems such as unused or duplicated code and out-of-order code execution.
    Data scientists can benefit from better tool support when maintaining and evolving notebooks.
    We argue that central to such tool support is identifying the structure of notebooks.
    We present a lightweight and accurate approach to extract notebook structure
    and outline several ways such structure can be used to improve maintenance tooling for notebooks,
    including navigation and finding alternatives.
