  <p>
    It's a difficult and vaguely antisocial thing to be dogmatic about
    but when I ask if there's any research about something I'm asking for actual research.
    As in,
    do you know if someone has dedicated months or years of their lives in some empirical pursuit of this question,
    and what they wrote down.
    As distinct from the first thing your imagination burped into your inner monologue when your eyes hit the "?".

    Trust me, I can make up my own imaginary, uninformed opinions faster than you can type.
