<p>
  Unless and until legislators give ad regulations some real teeth,
  we're going to have to rely on counter-measures.
  I can think of no better introduction and summary for this latest advance in that arms race
  than the one written by the authors themselves and quoted below.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    â€¦we propose an automatic detection technique that addresses the following challenges:
    (1) Advertisements can be fully dynamic where the structure of an ad is unknown until runtime,
    making it difficult to identify an ad and differentiate it from other elements.
    (2) Dynamically loaded ads can be highly volatile
    (e.g., first appear and then disappear at any time),
    which makes it difficult to localize dynamic ads in the source code.
    (3) Advertisements can be initially preloaded and later have their properties modified during runtime,
    thus a pure static/dynamic analysis alone does not suffice.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this end,
    we propose AdHere,
    a technique that can automatically detect violating ads and suggest repair proposals.
    The design of AdHere is based on a combination of static and dynamic analyses.
    It works by first parsing the initial web page to a DOM tree to search for potential static ads,
    and then using mutation observers to monitor and detect intrusive (dynamic/static) ads on the fly.
    To handle ads' volatile nature,
    AdHere includes two detection algorithms for desktop and mobile ads to identify different ad violations
    during three phases of page load events.
    Our approach recursively applies the detection algorithms to resolve nested layers of DOM elements
    inserted by ad delegations.
    We evaluate AdHere on Alexa Top 1 Million Websites to detect their compliance with the Better Ads Standards.
    AdHere detected violating ads on 5,540 mobile websites and 4,601 desktop websites.
    Compar[ed] to the currently available alternative,
    AdHere detected violations on 4,656 more mobile websites and 3,911 more desktop websites
    and improved recall (by 16.6%) and accuracy (by 4.2%).
