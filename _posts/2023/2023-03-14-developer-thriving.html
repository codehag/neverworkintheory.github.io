  <a href="https://www.catharsisinsight.com/">Cat Hicks</a> (who spoke at our first two live events),
  <a href="https://www.carol-s-lee-phd.com/">Carol Lee</a> (who's speaking next month),
  and their colleague Morgan Ramsey
  have released a new report:
  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/resource-center/guides/developer-thriving-research-paper">
    Developer Thriving:
    The Four Factors that Drive Software Developer Productivity Across Industries.
  </a>
  It's important, insightful work,
  and I hope it will spark useful conversations among your team.
