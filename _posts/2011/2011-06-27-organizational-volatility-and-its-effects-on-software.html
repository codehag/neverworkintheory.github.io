    The key premise of an organization is to allow more efficient
    production, including production of high quality software. To
    achieve that, an organization defines roles and reporting
    relationships. Therefore, changes in organization's structure are
    likely to affect product's quality. We propose and investigate a
    relationship between developer-centric measures of organizational
    change and the probability of customer-reported defects in the
    context of a large software project. We find that the proximity to
    an organizational change is significantly associated with
    reductions in software quality. We also replicate results of
    several prior studies of software quality supporting findings that
    code, change, and developer characteristics affect
    fault-proneness. In contrast to prior studies we find that
    distributed development decreases quality. Furthermore, recent
    departures from an organization were associated with increased
    probability of customer-reported defects, thus demonstrating that
    in the observed context the organizational change reduces product
    quality.

    The influx of newcomers into an organization does not seem to
    increase defects in its software, perhaps because newcomers get
    simple tasks at the start. However, other changes to the
    organization (and especially departures from it) hurt its software
    significantly. In his paper, Mockus notes that organizational
    volatility is <em>not</em> the main driver of defectsâ€”that would
    be the technical complexity of the code. But his organizational
    change measures still explain over 20% of the variance in
    fault-proneness of the code.
