    In this paper from 2018,
    De Pádua and Shang look at the relationship between anti-patterns in exception handling
    and error rates in the related code.
    Unsurprisingly, they find that bad exception handling practices correlate with post-release defects.
    What makes the work (much) more interesting is that only <em>some</em> anti-patterns correlate
    in a statistically significant way:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The longer the exception handling blocks in a file, the more likely the file is to contain bugs.
      What's more, the length of the file and the length of its exception handling blocks aren't correlated,
      so exception handler length really does contain novel information.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <em>Dummy Handler</em> and <em>Generic Catch</em> anti-patterns
      have a strong statistical relationship to defects.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <em>Ignoring Interrupted Exception</em> and <em>Log and Throw</em> patterns
      corelated with post-release defects in one of the projects they studied,
      but not all.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Studies like this one are why I pay attention to software engineering research.
    Code review checklists tend to grow over time,
    and the longer they get,
    the less useful they are.
    This paper doesn't claim that only four exception handling anti-patterns matter,
    but since I don't have time to check everything I'd want to when I'm looking over someone's code,
    knowing which anti-patterns are most important is a real help.
    It would be great to see this work repeated on a larger sample of projects,
    and even greater to see whether the same findings hold for programs in Python and other languages.
  </p>

    Finally, my usual grumble about the way abstracts are written in software engineering:
    the first three sentences of this one are unnecessary,
    as are the last two,
    and the authors could have used that space to tell casual browsers
    <em>which</em> exception handling anti-patterns correlate with post-release defects.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Modern programming languages, such as Java and C#, typically provide features
  that handle exceptions. These features separate error-handling code from
  regular source code and aim to assist in the practice of software
  comprehension and maintenance. Nevertheless, their misuse can still cause
  reliability degradation or even catastrophic software failures. Prior studies
  on exception handling revealed the suboptimal practices of the exception
  handling flows and the prevalence of their anti-patterns. However, little is
  known about the relationship between exception handling practices and software
  quality. In this work, we investigate the relationship between software
  quality (measured by the probability of having post-release defects) and: (i)
  exception flow characteristics and (ii) 17 exception handling
  anti-patterns. We perform a case study on three Java and C# open-source
  projects. By building statistical models of the probability of post-release
  defects using traditional software metrics and metrics that are associated
  with exception handling practice, we study whether exception flow
  characteristics and exception handling anti-patterns have a statistically
  significant relationship with post-release defects. We find that exception
  flow characteristics in Java projects have a significant relationship with
  post-release defects. In addition, although the majority of the exception
  handing anti-patterns are not significant in the models, there exist
  anti-patterns that can provide significant explanatory power to the
  probability of post-release defects. Therefore, development teams should
  consider allocating more resources to improving their exception handling
  practices and avoid the anti-patterns that are found to have a relationship
  with post-release defects. Our findings also highlight the need for techniques
  that assist in handling exceptions in the software development
  practice.
