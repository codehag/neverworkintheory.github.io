    Although static type systems are an essential part in teaching and
    research in software engineering and computer science, there is
    hardly any knowledge about what the impact of static type systems
    on the development time or the resulting quality for a piece of
    software is. On the one hand there are authors that state that
    static type systems decrease an application's complexity and hence
    its development time (which means that the quality must be
    improved since developers have more time left in their
    projects). On the other hand there are authors that argue that
    static type systems increase development time (and hence decrease
    the code quality) since they restrict developers to express
    themselves in a desired way. This paper presents an empirical
    study with 49 subjects that studies the impact of a static type
    system for the development of a parser over 27 hours working
    time. In the experiments the existence of the static type system
    has neither a positive nor a negative impact on an application's
    development time (under the conditions of the experiment).

    How many experiments in software engineering research are you
    aware of where the researcher developed a new programming language
    and corresponding IDE just for the experiment? Well, Stefan
    Hanenberg did exactly that, and the results are remarkable. The
    goal of his experiment was to measure the impact of static
    vs. dynamic type systems on development time and software
    quality. While there is a lot of conventional wisdom around the
    use of static or dynamic type systems (e.g., static type systems
    capture many recurring programming errors and make systems easier
    to maintain, dynamic type systems make life easier by not posing
    unnecessary restrictions), there is hardly any hard evidence to
    support these claims, and for a practitioner, it is unclear which
    arguments can be trusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike what has been done in previous work, Hanenberg decided not
    to use existing programming languages and IDEs in his experiment
    because he worried that subjects' familiarity with the tooling
    would influence the results, in particular if his subjects knew
    only the dynamic or only the static version used in the
    study. Therefore, he developed a new object-oriented programming
    language "Purity" (with some similarities to Smalltalk, Ruby and
    Java) and a corresponding IDE (class browser, test browser and
    console). Actually, he developed two versions of Purity: one with
    static types, the other one with a dynamic type system. The two
    versions were identical in all other aspects.
  </p>
  <p>
    His experimental setup followed a between-subject design (i.e.,
    each subject was only used once). He recruited 49 students,
    divided them into two groups, and taught each group one of the
    Purity versions (the dynamic type version was taught for 16 hours
    and the static type version was taught for 18 hours). All subjects
    were then given exactly 27 hours to implement a scanner and a
    parser for a given grammar. Hanenberg measured two outcomes:
    development time and quality. Development time was measured based
    on log entries and test cases in order to determine the exact
    point in time when subjects fulfilled all the test cases for a
    minimal scanner, and the quality of the parser was measured
    through 400 test cases that represented valid and invalids words
    in the grammar.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main result from Hanenberg's study is that—under the
    conditions of his experiment—the existence of a static type system
    did not have a positive impact on development time or quality. In
    fact, the subjects who used the dynamic type version of Purity
    were significantly faster in developing a scanner, but there was
    no statistically significant difference with respect to quality of
    the final product.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to conducting and describing a well-planned and
    well-executed experiment, Hanenberg does a thorough job explaining
    and justifying his choice of methods, both for data collection and
    data analysis. But he also discusses the limitations of his work
    in great depth—in particular that it is impossible to draw general
    conclusions from one experiment. However, what a single experiment
    such as Hanenberg's can do is cast doubts on the role of static
    type systems in software engineering, and his work opens up lots
    of venues for future work on which programming languages work
    better than others, and why.
