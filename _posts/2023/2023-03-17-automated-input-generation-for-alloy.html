<p>
  If you are reading this post,
  you have probably written code for distributed systems,
  but you probably <em>haven't</em> used any automated tools
  to verify that those systems work as intended.
  One reason for this is their user-hostile interfaces:
  while <a href="https://alloytools.org/">Alloy</a>,
  <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a>,
  and similar systems are powerful,
  the notations they use make Perl and Egyptian hieroglyphics seem readable by comparison.
</p>

<p>
  The authors of this paper have been tackling that
  by automating some of the grunt work involved in describing models for Alloy.
  Their previous tool, ASketch,
  took a partial model with user-specified holes,
  a generator which outlines valid substitutions for each hole,
  and a test suite outlining the expected behavior of the model,
  and produced a completed model that passed all the tests.
  This tool, SketchGen<sup>2</sup>,
  automatically creates some of those inputs.
  Using it still requires more understanding of formal specification than most developers currently have,
  but as with LLM-based code generators and static analysis tools,
  more and more of the effort required is shifting from programmers to programs.

    Writing declarative models has numerous benefits,
    ranging from automated reasoning and correction of design-level properties before systems are built,
    to automated testing and debugging of their implementations after they are built.
    Alloy is a declarative modeling language that is well suited for verifying system designs.
    While Alloy comes deployed in the Analyzer,
    an automated scenario-finding tool set,
    writing correct models remains a difficult and error-prone task.
    ASketch is a synthesis framework that helps users build their Alloy models.
    ASketch takes as an input a partial Alloy models with holes and an AUnit test suite.
    As output,
    ASketch returns a completed model that passes all tests.
    ASketch's initial evaluation reveals ASketch to be a promising approach to synthesize Alloy models.
    In this paper,
    we present and explore SketchGen<sup>2</sup>,
    an approach that looks to broaden the adoption of ASketch
    by increasing the automation of the inputs needed for the sketching process.
    Experimental results show SketchGen<sup>2</sup>
    is effective at producing both expressions and test suites for synthesis.
