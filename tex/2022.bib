  abstract = {Prior research has found mixed results on how economic inequality is related to various outcomes. These contradicting findings may in part stem from a predominant focus on the Gini coefficient, which only narrowly captures inequality. Here, we conceptualize the measurement of inequality as a data reduction task of income distributions. Using a uniquely fine-grained dataset of N = 3,056 US county-level income distributions, we estimate the fit of 17 previously proposed models and find that multi-parameter models consistently outperform single-parameter models (i.e., models that represent single-parameter measures like the Gini coefficient). Subsequent simulations reveal that the best-fitting model-the two-parameter Ortega model-distinguishes between inequality concentrated at lower- versus top-income percentiles. When applied to 100 policy outcomes from a range of fields (including health, crime and social mobility), the two Ortega parameters frequently provide directionally and magnitudinally different correlations than the Gini coefficient. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-parameter models and data-driven methods to study inequality.},

To be effective, they should allow bug triagers to easily understand and reproduce the potential reported bugs, by clearly describing the Observed Behavior (OB), the Steps to Reproduce (S2R), and the Expected Behavior (EB). Unfortunately, while considered extremely useful, reporters often miss such pieces of information in bug reports and, to date, there is no effective way to automatically check and enforce their presence. We manually analyzed nearly 3k bug reports to understand to what extent OB, EB, and S2R are reported in bug reports and what discourse patterns reporters use to describe such information. We found that (i) while most reports contain OB (i.e., 93.5\%), only 35.2\% and 51.4\% explicitly describe EB and S2R, respectively; and (ii) reporters recurrently use 154 discourse patterns to describe such content. Based on these findings, we designed and evaluated an automated approach to detect the absence (or presence) of EB and S2R in bug descriptions. With its best setting, our approach is able to detect missing EB (S2R) with 85.9\% (69.2\%) average precision and 93.2\% (83\%) average recall. Our approach intends to improve bug descriptions quality by alerting reporters about missing EB and S2R at reporting time.},

    products is key to enabling transitions to environmentally

    impacts of food commodities such as fruits, wheat, and beef
    [Poore and Nemecek, Science 360, 987-992 (2018)], most food
    products contain numerous ingredients. However, because the
    amount of each ingredient in a product is often known only by the
    manufacturer, it has been difficult to assess their environmental
    impacts. Here, we develop an approach to overcome this
    limitation. It uses prior knowledge from ingredient lists to
    infer the composition of each ingredient, and then pairs this
    with environmental databases [Poore and Nemecek Science 360,
    987-992 (2018); Gephart et al., Nature 597, 360-365 (2021)] to
    derive estimates of a food product's environmental impact across
    four indicators: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water
    stress, and eutrophication potential. Using the approach on
    57,000 products in the United Kingdom and Ireland shows food
    types have low (e.g., sugary beverages, fruits, breads), to
    intermediate (e.g., many desserts, pastries), to high
    environmental impacts (e.g., meat, fish, cheese). Incorporating
    NutriScore reveals more nutritious products are often more
    environmentally sustainable but there are exceptions to this
    trend, and foods consumers may view as substitutable can have
    markedly different impacts. Sensitivity analyses indicate the
    approach is robust to uncertainty in ingredient composition and
    in most cases sourcing. This approach provides a step toward
    enabling consumers, retailers, and policy makers to make informed
    decisions on the environmental impacts of food products.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Computational modeling is an increasingly common practice for disciplinary experts and therefore necessitates integration into science curricula. Computational models afford an opportunity for students to investigate the dynamics of biological systems, but there is significant gap in our knowledge of how these activities impact student knowledge of the structures, relationships, and dynamics of the system. We investigated how a computational modeling activity affected introductory biology students' mental models of a prokaryotic gene regulatory system (lac operon) by analyzing conceptual models created before and after the activity. Results Students' pre-lesson conceptual models consisted of provided, system-general structures (e.g., activator, repressor) connected with predominantly incorrect relationships, representing an incomplete mental model of gene regulation. Students' post-lesson conceptual models included more context-specific structures (e.g., cAMP, lac repressor) and increased in total number of structures and relationships. Student conceptual models also included higher quality relationships among structures, indicating they learned about these context-specific structures through integration with their expanding mental model rather than in isolation. Conclusions Student mental models meshed structures in a manner indicative of knowledge accretion while they were productively re-constructing their understanding of gene regulation. Conceptual models can inform instructors about how students are relating system structures and whether students are developing more sophisticated models of system-general and system-specific dynamics.},

    ``eradication of difference''},
  author = {Drage, Eleanor and Mackereth, Kerry},
  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze two key claims offered by recruitment
    AI companies in relation to the development and deployment of
    AI-powered HR tools: (1) recruitment AI can objectively assess
    candidates by removing gender and race from their systems, and
    (2) this removal of gender and race will make recruitment fairer,
    help customers attain their DEI goals, and lay the foundations
    for a truly meritocratic culture to thrive within an
    organization. We argue that these claims are misleading for four
    reasons: First, attempts to ``strip'' gender and race from AI
    systems often misunderstand what gender and race are, casting
    them as isolatable attributes rather than broader systems of
    power. Second, the attempted outsourcing of ``diversity work'' to
    AI-powered hiring tools may unintentionally entrench cultures of
    problems within organizations. Third, AI hiring tools' supposedly
    neutral assessment of candidates' traits belie the power
    relationship between the observer and the observed. Specifically,
    the racialized history of character analysis and its associated
    processes of classification and categorization play into longer
    histories of taxonomical sorting and reflect the current demands
    and desires of the job market, even when not explicitly conducted
    along the lines of gender and race. Fourth, recruitment AI tools
    help produce the ``ideal candidate'' that they supposedly
    identify through by constructing associations between words and
    people's bodies. From these four conclusions outlined above, we
    offer three key recommendations to AI HR firms, their customers,
    and policy makers going forward.},

  abstract = {One of the most commonly cited theories in computing education research is cognitive load theory (CLT), which explains how learning is affected by the bottleneck of human working memory and how teaching may work around that limitation. The theory has evolved over a number of decades, addressing shortcomings in earlier versions; other issues remain and are being debated by the CLT community. We conduct a systematic mapping review of how CLT has been used across a number of leading computing education research (CER) forums since 2010. We find that the most common reason to cite CLT is to mention it briefly as a design influence; authors predominantly cite old versions of the theory; hypotheses phrased in terms of cognitive load components are rare; and only a small selection of cognitive load measures have been applied, sparsely. Overall, the theory's evolution and recent themes in CLT appear to have had limited impact on CER so far. We recommend that studies in CER explain which version of the theory they use and why; clearly distinguish between load components (e.g., intrinsic and extraneous load); phrase hypotheses in terms of load components a priori ; look further into validating different measures of cognitive load; accompany cognitive load measures with complementary constructs, such as motivation; and explore themes such as collaborative CLT and individual differences in working-memory capacity.},

Differently from previous studies that rely on self-reporting mobile phone usage data, which tends to significantly underestimate the time spent by students at their phones, we employed Apps (namely `Moment' and `App Usage Tracker') to effectively measure actual usage. Collecting data from 43 students at Funda{\c c}{\~a}o Get{\'u}lio Vargas (FGV), a business school from S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil, our analysis yielded a significant negative relationship between total time spent using smartphones and academic performance, after controlling for known predictors of performance such as self-efficacy and past academic results. Each 100 min spent using the device on average per day corresponded to a reduction in a student's position at the school's ranking of 6.3 points, in a range from 0 to nearly 100. Moreover, if we consider usage during class time only (as opposed to during free time and weekends), the effect was almost twice as high. The magnitude of the effect found is alarming. Thus, this study brings new evidence of the potential harm of excessive smartphone use and should be useful for educators and other academic stakeholders interested in the subject of the impact of technology on students' performance.},

    documentation in improving research quality and impact.
    Computational notebooks are files that contain descriptive text,
    as well as code and its outputs, in a single, dynamic, and
    visually appealing file that is easier to understand by
    nonspecialists. Traditionally used by data scientists when
    producing reports and informing decision-making, the use of this
    tool in research publication is not common, despite its potential
    to increase research impact and quality. For a single study, the
    content of such documentation partially overlaps with that of
    classical lab notebooks and that of the scientific manuscript
    reporting the study. Therefore, to minimize the amount of work
    required to manage all the files related to these contents and
    optimize their production, we present a starter kit to facilitate
    the implementation of computational notebooks in the research
    process, including publication. The kit contains the template of
    a computational notebook integrated into a research project that
    employs R, Python, or Julia. Using examples of ecological
    studies, we show how computational notebooks also foster the
    implementation of principles of Open Science, such as
    reproducibility and traceability. The kit is designed for
    beginners, but at the end we present practices that can be
    gradually implemented to develop a fully digital research

    kit will encourage researchers to adopt this practice in their

  abstract = {In the two decades following its initial release, SQLite has become the most widely deployed database engine in existence. Today, SQLite is found in nearly every smartphone, computer, web browser, television, and automobile. Several factors are likely responsible for its ubiquity, including its in-process design, standalone codebase, extensive test suite, and cross-platform file format. While it supports complex analytical queries, SQLite is primarily designed for fast online transaction processing (OLTP), employing row-oriented execution and a B-tree storage format. However, fueled by the rise of edge computing and data science, there is a growing need for efficient in-process online analytical processing (OLAP). DuckDB, a database engine nicknamed ``the SQLite for analytics'', has recently emerged to meet this demand. While DuckDB has shown strong performance on OLAP benchmarks, it is unclear how SQLite compares. Furthermore, we are aware of no work that attempts to identify root causes for SQLite's performance behavior on OLAP workloads. In this paper, we discuss SQLite in the context of this changing workload landscape. We describe how SQLite evolved from its humble beginnings to the full-featured database engine it is today. We evaluate the performance of modern SQLite on three benchmarks, each representing a different flavor of in-process data management, including transactional, analytical, and blob processing. We delve into analytical data processing on SQLite, identifying key bottlenecks and weighing potential solutions. As a result of our optimizations, SQLite is now up to 4.2X faster on SSB. Finally, we discuss the future of SQLite, envisioning how it will evolve to meet new demands and challenges.},

Psychology theory can facilitate the systematic and sound development as well as the adoption of instruments (e.g., psychological tests, questionnaires) to assess these constructs. In particular, to ensure high quality, the psychometric properties of instruments need evaluation. In this article, we provide an introduction to psychometric theory for the evaluation of measurement instruments for SE researchers. We present guidelines that enable using existing instruments and developing new ones adequately. We conducted a comprehensive review of the psychology literature framed by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. We detail activities used when operationalizing new psychological constructs, such as item pooling, item review, pilot testing, item analysis, factor analysis, statistical property of items, reliability, validity, and fairness in testing and test bias. We provide an openly available example of a psychometric evaluation based on our guideline. We hope to encourage a culture change in SE research towards the adoption of established methods from psychology. To improve the quality of behavioral research in SE, studies focusing on introducing, validating, and then using psychometric instruments need to be more common.},

By consistently ranking certain content higher, these algorithms may amplify some messages while reducing the visibility of others. There's been intense public and scholarly debate about the possibility that some political groups benefit more from algorithmic amplification than others. We provide quantitative evidence from a long-running, massive-scale randomized experiment on the Twitter platform that committed a randomized control group including nearly 2 million daily active accounts to a reverse-chronological content feed free of algorithmic personalization. We present two sets of findings. First, we studied tweets by elected legislators from major political parties in seven countries. Our results reveal a remarkably consistent trend: In six out of seven countries studied, the mainstream political right enjoys higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left. Consistent with this overall trend, our second set of findings studying the US media landscape revealed that algorithmic amplification favors right-leaning news sources. We further looked at whether algorithms amplify far-left and far-right political groups more than moderate ones; contrary to prevailing public belief, we did not find evidence to support this hypothesis. We hope our findings will contribute to an evidence-based debate on the role personalization algorithms play in shaping political content consumption.},

  author = {C{\'a}novas Izquierdo, Javier Luis and Cabot, Jordi},
  abstract = {AbstractThe role of non-coding contributors in Open Source Software (OSS) is poorly understood. Most of current research around OSS development focuses on the coding aspects of the project (e.g., commits, pull requests or code reviews) while ignoring the potential of other types of contributions. Often, due to the assumption that these other contributions are not significant in number and that, in any case, they are handled by the same people that are also part of the ``coding team''. This paper aims to investigate whether this is actually the case by analyzing the frequency and diversity of non-coding contributions in OSS development. As a sample of projects for our study we have taken the 100 most popular projects in the ecosystem of NPM, a package manager for JavaScript. Our results validate the importance of dedicated non-coding contributors in OSS and the diversity of OSS communities as, typically, a contributor specializes in a specific subset of roles. We foresee that projects adopting explicit policies to attract and onboard them could see a positive impact in their long-term sustainability providing they also put in place the right governance strategies to facilitate the migration and collaboration among the different roles. As part of this work, we also provide a replicability package to facilitate further quantitative role-based analysis by other researchers.},

  author = {Joblin, Mitchell and Apel, Sven},
  abstract = {Software development is at the intersection of the social realm , involving people who develop the software, and the technical realm , involving artifacts (code, docs, etc.) that are being produced. It has been shown that a socio-technical perspective provides rich information about the state of a software project. In particular, we are interested in socio-technical factors that are associated with project success . For this purpose, we frame the task as a network classification problem. We show how a set of heterogeneous networks composed of social and technical entities can be jointly embedded in a single vector space enabling mathematically sound comparisons between distinct software projects. Our approach is specifically designed using intuitive metrics stemming from network analysis and statistics to ease the interpretation of results in the context of software engineering wisdom. Based on a selection of 32 open-source projects, we perform an empirical study to validate our approach considering three prediction scenarios to test the classification model's ability generalizing to: (1) randomly held-out project snapshots, (2) future project states, and (3) entirely new projects. Our results provide evidence that a socio-technical perspective is superior to a pure social or technical perspective when it comes to early indicators of future project success. To our surprise, the methodology proposed here even shows evidence of being able to generalize to entirely novel (project hold-out set) software projects reaching predication accuracies of 80\%, which is a further testament to the efficacy of our approach and beyond what has been possible so far. In addition, we identify key features that are strongly associated with project success. Our results indicate that even relatively simple socio-technical networks capture highly relevant and interpretable information about the early indicators of future project success.},

Such beliefs are likely affected by people's intuitive theories of the real world. In three studies, people judged the effort required to cast spells that cause physical violations. People ranked the actions of spells congruently with intuitive physics. For example, people judge that it requires more effort to conjure up a frog than to levitate it one foot off the ground. A second study manipulated the target and extent of the spells, and demonstrated with a continuous measure that people are sensitive to this manipulation even between participants. A pre-registered third study replicated the results of Study 2. These results suggest that people's intuitive theories partly account for how they think about imaginary worlds.},

  abstract = {There is a well-documented gap between the observed number of works produced by women and by men in science, with clear consequences for the retention and promotion of women1. The gap might be a result of productivity differences2-5, or it might be owing to women's contributions not being acknowledged6,7. Here we find that at least part of this gap is the result of unacknowledged contributions: women in research teams are significantly less likely than men to be credited with authorship. The findings are consistent across three very different sources of data. Analysis of the first source-large-scale administrative data on research teams, team scientific output and attribution of credit-show that women are significantly less likely to be named on a given article or patent produced by their team relative to their male peers. The gender gap in attribution is present across most scientific fields and almost all career stages. The second source-an extensive survey of authors-similarly shows that women's scientific contributions are systematically less likely to be recognized. The third source-qualitative responses-suggests that the reason that women are less likely to be credited is because their work is often not known, is not appreciated or is ignored. At least some of the observed gender gap in scientific output may be owing not to differences in scientific contribution, but rather to differences in attribution.},

  abstract = {AbstractOpen source software projects often use issue repositories, where project contributors submit bug reports. Using these repositories, more bugs in software projects may be identified and fixed. However, the content and therefore quality of bug reports vary. In this study, we aim to understand the significance of different elements in bug reports. We interviewed 35 developers to gain insights into their perceptions on the importance of various contents in bug reports. To assess our findings, we surveyed 305 developers. The results show developers find it highly important that bug reports include crash description, reproducing steps or test cases, and stack traces. Software version, fix suggestions, code snippets, and attached contents have lower importance for software debugging. Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of currently available bug reports, we mined issue repositories of 250 most popular projects on Github. Statistical analysis on the mined issues shows that crash reproducing steps, stack traces, fix suggestions, and user contents, have statistically significant impact on bug resolution times, for ∼70\%, ∼76\%, ∼55\%, and ∼33\% of the projects. However, on avarage, over 70\% of bug reports lack these elements.},

  author = {Strode, Diane and Dings{\o}yr, Torgeir and Lindsjorn, Yngve},
  abstract = {AbstractTeamwork is crucial in software development, particularly in agile development teams which are cross-functional and where team members work intensively together to develop a cohesive software solution. Effective teamwork is not easy; prior studies indicate challenges with communication, learning, prioritization, and leadership. Nevertheless, there is much advice available for teams, from agile methods, practitioner literature, and general studies on teamwork to a growing body of empirical studies on teamwork in the specific context of agile software development. This article presents the agile teamwork effectiveness model (ATEM) for colocated agile development teams. The model is based on evidence from focus groups, case studies, and multi-vocal literature and is a revision of a general team effectiveness model. Our model of agile teamwork effectiveness is composed of shared leadership, team orientation, redundancy, adaptability, and peer feedback. Coordinating mechanisms are needed to facilitate these components. The coordinating mechanisms are shared mental models, communication, and mutual trust. We critically examine the model and discuss extensions for very small, multi-team, distributed, and safety-critical development contexts. The model is intended for researchers, team members, coaches, and leaders in the agile community.},

  author = {Wang, Zhendong and Feng, Yang and Wang, Yi and Jones, James A and Redmiles, David},
  abstract = {Open source developers, particularly the elite developers who own the administrative privileges for a project, maintain a diverse portfolio of contributing activities. They not only commit source code but also exert significant efforts on other communicative, organizational, and supportive activities. However, almost all prior research focuses on specific activities and fails to analyze elite developers' activities in a comprehensive way. To bridge this gap, we conduct an empirical study with fine-grained event data from 20 large open source projects hosted on G IT H UB . We investigate elite developers' contributing activities and their impacts on project outcomes. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (1) elite developers participate in a variety of activities, of which technical contributions (e.g., coding) only account for a small proportion; (2) as the project grows, elite developers tend to put more effort into supportive and communicative activities and less effort into coding; and (3) elite developers' efforts in nontechnical activities are negatively correlated with the project's outcomes in terms of productivity and quality in general, except for a positive correlation with the bug fix rate (a quality indicator). These results provide an integrated view of elite developers' activities and can inform an individual's decision making about effort allocation, which could lead to improved project outcomes. The results also provide implications for supporting these elite developers.},

We hypothesize that readers use the real world as a starting point and investigate how much and which types of real-world information is imported into a given fictional world. We presented subjects (N=52) with three stories and asked them to judge whether real world facts held true in the story world. Subjects' responses indicated that they imported many facts into fiction, though what exactly is imported depends on two main variables: (1) the distance that a narrative world lies from reality and (2) the types of fact being imported. Facts that are true of the real world are more likely to be imported into worlds that are more similar to the real world, and facts that are more central to the representation of the real world are more likely to be imported overall. These results indicate that subjects make nuanced inferences when creating fictional worlds, basing their representations both on how different a story world is from the real world and on what they know to be causally central to the real world.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Although worldwide inventories of glacier area have been coordinated internationally for several decades, a similar effort for glacier ice thicknesses was only initiated in 2013. Here, we present the third version of the Glacier Thickness Database (GlaThiDa v3), which includes 3 854 279 thickness measurements distributed over more than 3000 glaciers worldwide. Overall, 14 \% of global glacier area is now within 1 km of a thickness measurement -- a significant improvement over GlaThiDa v2, which covered only 6 \% of global glacier area, and only 1100 glaciers. In this paper, we summarize the sources and compilation of glacier thickness data and the spatial and temporal coverage of the resulting database. In addition, we detail our use of open-source metadata formats and software tools to describe the data, validate the data against this description, and track changes to the data following modern data management best-practices. Archived versions GlaThiDa are available from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (https://doi.org/10.5904/wgms-glathida-2019-03; GlaThiDa Consortium (2019)) and the development version (v3.1.0-rc1, from which this manuscript draft is generated) is available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/wgms/glathida/-/tree/v3.1.0-rc1).},

  title = {Social-psychological interventions in education},
  author = {Yeager, David S and Walton, Gregory M},
  abstract = {Recent randomized experiments have found that seemingly ``small'' social-psychological interventions in education---that is, brief exercises that target students' thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in and about school---can lead to large gains in student achievement and sharply reduce achievement gaps even months and years later. These interventions do not teach students academic content but instead target students' psychology, such as their beliefs that they have the potential to improve their intelligence or that they belong and are valued in school. When social-psychological interventions have lasting effects, it can seem surprising and even ``magical,'' leading people either to think of them as quick fixes to complicated problems or to consider them unworthy of serious consideration. The present article discourages both responses. It reviews the theoretical basis of several prominent social-psychological interventions and emphasizes that they have lasting effects because they target students' subjective experiences in school, because they use persuasive yet stealthy methods for conveying psychological ideas, and because they tap into recursive processes present in educational environments. By understanding psychological interventions as powerful but context-dependent tools, educational researchers will be better equipped to take them to scale. This review concludes by discussing challenges to scaling psychological interventions and how these challenges may be overcome.},
