<p>
  People have been writing software for over seventy years,
  and studying it for nearly as long,
  but most programmers don't know what researchers have discovered,
  and most researchers aren't looking at the problems developers would most like solved.

<p>
  We can do better.
  On Tuesday, April 26, and Wednesday, April 27,
  It Will Never Work in Theory is offering its third live event:
  a set of lightning talks from leading researchers
  on immediate, actionable results from their work.
  [FIXME: insert teasers for some topics here]
  Our speakers will share what we know about these questions and why we believe it's true.
