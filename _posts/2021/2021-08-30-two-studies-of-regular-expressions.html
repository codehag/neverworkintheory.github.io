  <p>
    Regular expressions are like <a href="{{'/2021/08/27/errors-in-sql-queries.html' | relative_url}}">SQL</a>:
    most large applications use regex,
    but they have been overlooked by most researchers until recently.
    These two papers are therefore both very welcome additions to the literature.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Davis2019</cite> examines how portable regex are
    versus how portable programmers <em>think</em> they are.
    The authors examined over half a million regex from programs in 8 different languages
    and found that 15% behaved differently across languages.
    Considering that 90% of programmers surveyed re-use regex found on the Internet or in other programs,
    frequently without thinking about language differences,
    this can be a fertile field for hard-to-find errors.
    Along the way,
    they found bugs in the regex engines of the V8 implementation of JavaScript,
    as well as Python, Ruby, and Rust,
    as well as significant performance differences that could be exploired for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Wang2020a</cite> focuses on bugs in the regex themselves.
    They found that almost half are due to incorrect regular expression behavior,
    while just under 10% are caused by mis-using the regex API.
    The hierarchical breakdown of these causes and others that they present is given
    in a table too complex to easily reproduce here;
    the authors also analyze the distribution of regex-related changes
    and their relationship to different problems' root causes and manifestations.
    Finally,
    they present 10 patterns that will fix many common regex bugs,
    ranging from extending the character class in a match
    to check for null values in regex execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the devil is in the details,
    then so too are most opportunities for improving programmers' lives.
    Knowing that a regex copied from a PHP program
    is going to behave slightly differently in JavaScript
    is a necessary first step toward building tools to detect, warn about, and correct the problem,
    while knowing how programmers mis-use the <code>|</code> operator
    is a first step toward generating a better error message.
    I hope we see more papers from both groups.

  This paper explores the extent to which regular expressions (regexes) are
  portable across programming languages. Many languages offer similar regex
  syntaxes, and it would be natural to assume that regexes can be ported across
  language boundaries. But can regexes be copy/pasted across language boundaries
  while retaining their semantic and performance characteristics? In our survey
  of 158 professional software developers, most indicated that they re-use
  regexes across language boundaries and about half reported that they believe
  regexes are a universal language. We experimentally evaluated the riskiness of
  this practice using a novel regex corpus—537,806 regexes from 193,524 projects
  written in JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, Perl, and Rust. Using our
  polyglot regex corpus, we explored the hitherto-unstudied regex portability
  problems: logic errors due to semantic differences, and security
  vulnerabilities due to performance differences. We report that developers’
  belief in a regex lingua franca is understandable but unfounded. Though most
  regexes compile across language boundaries, 15% exhibit semantic differences
  across languages and 10% exhibit performance differences across languages. We
  explained these differences using regex documentation, and further illuminate
  our findings by investigating regex engine implementations. Along the way we
  found bugs in the regex engines of JavaScript-V8, Python, Ruby, and Rust, and
  potential semantic and performance regex bugs in thousands of modules.

  Understanding the nature of regular expression (regex) issues is important to
  tackle practical issues developers face in regular expression usage. Knowledge
  about the nature and frequency of various types of regular expression issues,
  such as those related to performance, API misuse, and code smells, can guide
  testing, inform documentation writers, and motivate refactoring
  efforts. However, beyond ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service), little
  is known about to what extent regular expression issues affect software
  development and how these issues are addressed in practice. This paper
  presents a comprehensive empirical study of 350 merged regex-related pull
  requests from Apache, Mozilla, Facebook, and Google GitHub
  repositories. Through classifying the root causes and manifestations of those
  bugs, we show that incorrect regular expression behavior is the dominant root
  cause of regular expression bugs (165/356, 46.3%). The remaining root causes
  are incorrect API usage (9.3%) and other code issues that require regular
  expression changes in the fix (29.5%). By studying the code changes of
  regex-related pull requests, we observe that fixing regular expression bugs is
  nontrivial as it takes more time and more lines of code to fix them compared
  to the general pull requests. The results of this study contribute to a
  broader understanding of the practical problems faced by developers when using
  regular expressions.
